To generate index.html dynamically:

# Already a new repo on saibaba in $HOME/git/sangeetdhwani
# If not you can clone it
# git clone git@github.com:jtanisha-ee/sangeetdhwani.git
# cd sangeetdhwani
# OR if there is a repo you can pull the latest
# cd sangeetdhwani
# git pull

# In order to generate a new index.html that displays slideshow
# you will need to download the images to your git folder
# download current images from AWS s3://sangeeetdhwani.org/images 
# copy new images into <sd-git-dir>/images/YYYYMMDD folder based on concert date
# the images are not in git, as they are in gigabytes.
# The AWS s3 is the master for the images. THere is also a local
# copy of the folder on redbasin@saibaba.local under 
# $HOME/git/sangeetdhwani/images. Hopefully this directory is uptodate.
# When in doubt you can compare what's on S3 with this directory. They
# should have the same number of files. Downloading images from S3 takes
# quite a while. So you can hopefully use the images from this local
# directory. Uploading images back to S3 also takes time.

python genslideshow.py
mv index.html index.html.prev
mv genshow.html index.html

# git bash commands
git add index.html index.html.prev
git -m "comment" .
git push

# Upload the index.html to s3 bucket and publish it
# Upload the new concert folder YYYYMMDD to s3 and publish it
# You will need to create folder YYYYMMDD and then upload photos inside it
